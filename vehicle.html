            <h2>ELECTRIC VEHICLES (EVs)</h2>
            <img src="EV.jpg" alt="Descriptive alt text">
            <p>
                One of the most significant advancements in vehicle technology is the rise of electric vehicles (EVs). EVs offer a more sustainable alternative to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles by using electric motors powered by rechargeable batteries. This shift towards electric mobility has led to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. Additionally, EVs offer benefits such as lower maintenance costs and improved energy efficiency. Major automakers are investing heavily in EV technology, and the infrastructure for charging stations is rapidly expanding worldwide.

            <h2> AUTONOMOUSE VEHICLES</h2>
            <img src="AI.jpg" alt="Descriptive alt text">
            <p>Autonomous, or self-driving, vehicles represent a groundbreaking advancement in automotive technology. These vehicles use an array of sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to navigate roads and make decisions without human intervention. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to significantly reduce accidents caused by human error and improve traffic flow and fuel efficiency. While fully autonomous vehicles are still in development and face regulatory challenges, partial automation features such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist are already available in many modern cars. </p>
